Following the romantic spirit of old westerns paired with a bit of grit and a touch of carefulness, the new look for Arizona Cactus Quarter Horses is one that focuses on their pride and joy, foundation bloodlines with emphisis on mares.

Originating in Wyoming, the Arizona Cactus brand has found it's way to Washington state. In recent years expanded to a beautiful family of unique and diverse horses with bloodlines from all over. The team at Arizona Cactus take care in finding good homes for the horses for families looking for a new member, a competitive partner or to grow their own family of horses.

The logo is drawn from the old family Arizona Cactus brand. It's bold simplicity is mimiced throughout the site paired with pops of desert rose red and sage brush green uplifting the bold, kind imagery that best reflects the foundational core of motherely mares. We chose to go with a simple site that provides an easy read and hirachy of information for people of all ages to interact with.
