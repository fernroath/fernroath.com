Suprise! You've been on this project all along!

Every good designer needs a portfolio that refeclts their client work and themselves. I set out to build my own useing HTML & CSS. I have a stong interest is bringing animation and illustration to life on the web, and wanted to add a dash of fun to my own site useing basic use of CSS stylings and SVGs.

My overall goal for this, besides neeeding a new online portoflio, was to explore and understand the bridge between design and code better so that the process of designing interfaces (UI), experiences (UX) and code was covered across the board. My next goal is to set out figuring out Java Script. Wish me luck.

This site was designed and is responsive across desktop, tablet and mobile sizes.
