Every good designer needs a portfolio that refeclts their client work and themselves. I've had trouble finding layouts and styles that really fit me and my work, so I set out to design and code my own useing HTML & CSS + a little JavaScript.

My overall goal for this, besides neeeding a new online portoflio, was to explore and understand the bridge between design and code better so that the process of designing interfaces (UI), experiences (UX) and code was covered across the board. This site was also designed to be responsive across desktop, tablet and mobile sizes.

My next goal is to dig deeper into Java Script and explore creating fun and itneresting animations on the web useing SVGs.
