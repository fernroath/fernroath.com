Material Memory Art Show at Gold Bar Seattle

I originally wanted to illustrate the feeling/memory of playing the PS1 classic title Final Fantasy VIII with my brother growing up.

As I explored the prompt of Material Memory, I found that my own memories of the data on the 4 discs, the story itself was slightly warped. Locations (I thought most of the game involved the moon) and main goals of the game became distorted and compressed. So, despite the skewing of the visuals, colors and even main events in the game, these are the memories I have playing this game with my brother.

My vision when I was a child was drastically different when viewing and absorbing complex characters and emotions I didn’t entirely understand. Now I can clearly see what my past self processed, accepted and rejected. It’s these warped views and now, currently clean perception of the story (now a non-tangible, digital & remastered form) are things that have weaved me into today and into tomorrow.
