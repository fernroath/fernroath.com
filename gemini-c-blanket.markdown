Gemini C was produced for the Summer School Collective’s summer poster show, “Comfort; A poster show but with blankets” that took place at Consign Design in Seattle, WA on September 8th, 2017.

This particular blanket was designed with focus on comfort in an exposure & bringing beauty to being supportive of oneself.
